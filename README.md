### ⚙ **Business logic & behaviors:**

- **Edit / Borrow:**
  - Quantity cannot exceed available copies
  - Copies ≤ 0 → mark book unavailable in UI
- **After create / update / delete:**
  - Redirect appropriately & refresh list
- **Borrow Book flow:**
  - On borrow → redirect to `/borrow-summary`
- **Borrow summary:**
  - Uses aggregation API to show total quantity borrowed per book
